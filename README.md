Zetory project - Power by Flutter

## Features
- Interaction with network
- `Clean Architecture` Pattern
- Database implementation by:
    * Caching list of albums data
    * Mocking with data in assets
- Implementation of PhotoViewer with `Hero` and `GestureDetector` (Zoomable Image)
- `factory` constructor pattern of Dart (as singleton in other language)
- Using `pathprovider` for creating and accessing a cached file (works in both iOS and Android)

## Note 
(skip if not running on iOS)

Now Flutter has a bug with iOS debug.
```
fatal error: 'image_picker/ImagePickerPlugin.h' file not found
fatal error: 'path_provider/PathProviderPlugin.h' file not found
```
Solution:
- first: Run project in a iOS device
- Copy [ImagePickerPlugin.h](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/packages/image_picker/ios/Classes/ImagePickerPlugin.h) into ../path/to/zetory/build/ios/Debug-iphones/image_picker/image_picker.framework/Header
- Copy [PathProviderPlugin.h](https://github.com/flutter/plugins/blob/master/packages/path_provider/ios/Classes/PathProviderPlugin.h) into ../path/to/zetory/build/ios/Debug-iphones/path_provider/pat_provider.framework/Header
